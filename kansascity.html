        <h3>Origin of Kansas City</h3>
        <p"">"The origins of Kansas City date to the early 1800s, when French fur traders arrived by the Missouri River and built rough cabins along the river. The town of Kansas was formed in 1838 and a trail connecting the river landing to the Santa Fe Trail in the town of Westport was established.  Several years later commercial buildings were popping up along the river bluffs.  The era leading up to the Civil War was a tense and bloody time in Kansas City, as Missouri was a slave state and Kansas a free state. The Battle of Westport–one of bloodiest battles west of the Mississippi–took place in what today is Loose Park and Forest Hill Cemetery. With the Union prevailing, the city remained divided. Northerners preferred to live on the west side of Main Street on streets dubbed Pennsylvania, Broadway and Washington, and Southerners on the east side on streets such as Oak, Walnut and Locust. By 1870 a downtown street grid had been established" (Historic Kansas City).</p>
