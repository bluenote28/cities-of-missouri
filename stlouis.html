        <h3>Origin of St. Louis</h3>
        <p>The area was originally inhabited by mound builders of the Mississippian culture. The French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet passed by during their exploration of the Mississippi in 1673. In 1764 Pierre Lacl√®de Liguest of New Orleans founded a fur-trading post on the site, which at the time was located in Spanish territory. It was laid out by Auguste Chouteau and named for the canonized king Louis IX of France. St. Louis was later retroceded (1800) to France and, following the Louisiana Purchase (1803), became part of the United States. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition departed from St. Louis on its great exploratory journey to the Pacific Northwest. The city was the seat of government for the Louisiana (1805) and Missouri (1812) territories (Britannica).</p></section>
